Hey there, this profile will be simplistic.

-I’m kasua02.

-I’m interested in Reverse Engineering. I am mainly programming in C/C++/Python.

-Achievements so far:

            -2021 (first time and with lots of help): FLARE-ON 8 finisher(satokon), MalwareBytes CTF 2021.
            
            -2022: Publish PoC of injection/persistance techniques and Qakbot Dll stager paper/FLARE-ON 9 finisher (kasua) (definetely less help than the first time).

Current objectives:

            -Getting better at: 
                        -Tooling dev: C2 emulation purposes mainly.
                        -Deobfuscation: VM and CF deobfuscation.
                        -Windows Internals: Kernel development.
                        
            -Software Engineering: 
                        -Design patterns.
                        -Constructs from a reversing POV (Golang, NIM, Rust)      
            
-The quality of the code is not the best, slowly improving.
