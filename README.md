Hey there, this profile will be simplistic.

-I’m kasua02.

-I’m interested in Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering, with a touch in automation, mainly program in C/C++, and Python. Soon x86-x64 with NASM.

-Achievements so far:

            -2021 (first time and with lots of help): FLARE-ON 8 finisher, MalwareBytes CTF 2021.
            
            -2022: Publish PoC of injection/persistance techniques and Qakbot Dll stager paper.

Pending for the year (2022):
      
            -Improvement: C/C++ reversing/IDAPython scripting/Symbolic execution. 
      
            -C2 Emulators for Qakbot and ICEID. (Private but if you want to collaborate, PM me.)
      
            -Improving Windows Internals/Dev (Windows system programming experiments).
      
            -If I have time, participate in FLARE-ON 9 and win.

-The quality of the code is not the best, mainly for learning purposes.
