Hey there, this profile will be simplistic.

-I’m kasua02.

-I’m interested in Reverse Engineering. I am mainly programming in C/C++/Python.

-Achievements so far:

            -2021 (first time and with lots of help): FLARE-ON 8 finisher(satokon), MalwareBytes CTF 2021.
            
            -2022: Publish PoC of injection/persistance techniques and Qakbot Dll stager paper/FLARE-ON 9 finisher (kasua).

Current objectives (2022):
      
            -Getting better at: Tooling dev/Deobfuscation/Windows Internals.
      
            -Software Engineering: Design patterns, Programming language internals from a reversing POV (Golang, etc)
      
            
-The quality of the code is not the best, slowly improving.
