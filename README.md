Hey there, this profile will be simplistic since i dont really think its necessary to do too much presentations.

-I’m kasua02/satokon, university student.

-I’m interested in Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering. 
      
      -Most things here are going to be scripts related to CTF or decryption scripts.
            -I have won FLARE-ON and MalwareBytes CTF this 2021, with lots of help since it was my first time :)
      -This is not meant to total beginners, its mostly intermediate level knowledge.

-I’m currently learning/reviewing C/C++, x86-x64, and Python. 

-The quality of the code its not the best, most of the things here are experiments ive done to learn 
more about certain things, but i hope it interests people.
